## Results (N = 100,000 draws, seed = 42)

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **β_W median** | **6.27** |
| β_W mean | 6.32 |
| β_W std | 0.83 |
| **90% CI** | **[5.1, 7.8]** |
| 99% CI | [4.6, 8.5] |
| P(β_W < 1) | 0.0000% |
| **ΔW median** | **$3,084.7B/yr** |
| Π (revenue) | $492.0B/yr |

**β_W = 6.27** means the tax havens industry destroys **$6.27 in system
welfare for every $1.00 in revenue** — across 6 channels and 100,000 Monte Carlo draws.

**Classification**: Class 2 — Intractability

---

## What Is β_W?

```
β_W = ΔW / Π
```

- **ΔW** = total annualized welfare destruction ($B/yr) across all channels
- **Π** = annual industry **revenue** ($B/yr) — not profit

β_W > 1: industry destroys more welfare than it captures in revenue.
β_W > 3: Strong Intractability threshold — reform requires structural replacement.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epostnieks/sapm-mc-tax-havens.git
cd sapm-mc-tax-havens
pip install numpy scipy
python mc_simulation.py
```

Expected output: `β_W median : 6.27` and `ΔW median : $3,084.7B/yr`

## Welfare Channels

| Channel | Median ($B/yr) | 90% CI | Distribution |
|---------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| C1_fiscal_drain | $491.7B | [$391.3B, $591.6B] | Normal |
| C2_public_services | $639.7B | [$481.4B, $851.8B] | Lognormal |
| C3_inequality | $519.8B | [$360.6B, $749.7B] | Lognormal |
| C4_financial_stability | $480.4B | [$328.7B, $699.2B] | Lognormal |
| C5_governance | $419.4B | [$294.4B, $598.4B] | Lognormal |
| C6_developing_countries | $499.5B | [$333.6B, $749.9B] | Lognormal |
| **Total ΔW** | **$3,084.7B** | **[$2,490.2B, $3,830.6B]** | Correlated (ρ=0.3) |

## Impossibility Floor

The floor β_W ≥ 2.5 cannot be breached by any policy while the
industry continues to operate. In 100,000 draws, only **0.0000%**
fall below this floor — confirming the structural constraint.

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mc_simulation.py` | Self-contained simulation — no private pipeline imports |
| `mc_results.json` | Pre-run results (100K draws, seed=42) — matches paper |
| `mc_histogram.json` | Binned β_W distribution (80 bins) for companion chart |
| `assumptions.md` | Every parameter: value, derivation, source |
| `data_sources.md` | Full citation list for all empirical inputs |

## Replication Notes

Results are seeded and deterministic. Tested with:
```
numpy==1.26.4  scipy==1.12.0  Python 3.11.9
```

The `median` and `ci_90` (to 1 decimal) match exactly across compatible versions.
